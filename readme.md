#### readme file for Number Guesser project

//Comps were supplied for a number guessing game.
#### This is the commit that I submitted for the assignment.
This project includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive number guessing game.

Google fonts were used to match the comp.

Styles were added to make the design mobile friendly utilizing media queries.

The objective of the game is to guess the randomly generated number.  The number is between 1 and 100 for this example.  When the player enters a number in the input box and presses the GUESS button, they will receive feedback about the guess.  They will be told if the number is greater than or less than the answer.  They will receive a "BOOM!" if they guess correctly.  The players last guess will be displayed in pink on the screen.  The player can press clear to clear their last guess and enter a new one.  They can reset the game to start over.

The functionality to change the range does not work yet.

This is a very fun game.
